# continuum-literature-dataset


The "Continuum Literature Dataset"

This curated dataset contains a graph representation of research output
and technologies around Continuum Cloud computing. It covers over x works from y to
z in its second revision.

This dataset is produced by the scripts of the "Serverless Literature
Dataset", rebranded in generic form to "Structured Literature Dataset".
Therefore, the SLD needs to be downloaded first and this folder needs to
be placed into it in order to use the scripts when adding new entries or
producing statistics.
